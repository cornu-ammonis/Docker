docker notes:
EXPOSE {port#} makes the specified portavailable to outside world

WORKDIR /app
ADD . /app
above two lines will define the working directory as "/app" and 
copy current directory contents into the /app container directory


CMD["python", "app.py"] would run python app.py when container launches


docker build -t friendlyhello . 
creates a docker image and tags it as friendly hello
-t tag 

docker images 
lists images in registry

docker run -p 4000:80 
runs the app and maps the machine port 4000 to the exposed port 80
-p 
map ports

-d 
run in background, in detached mode

docker ps 
lists containers and ids

docker stop {container ID}
stops specified process

docker login
login

The notation for associating a local image with a repository on a 
registry, is username/repository:tag

docker tag friendlyhello username/repository:tag
Upload your tagged image:

docker push username/repository:tag
Once complete, the results of this upload are publicly available. From now on, you can use docker run and run your app on any machine with this command:

docker run -p 4000:80 username/repository:tag
or
docker run -p 80:80 username/repo:tag
to map it to
http://localhost/


A service really just means, “containers in production.” A service only runs one image, but it codifies the way that image runs – what ports it should use, how many replicas of the container should run so the service has the capacity it needs, and so on.
